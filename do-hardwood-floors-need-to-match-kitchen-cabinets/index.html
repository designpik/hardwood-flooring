<p>The answer to this question is something you have to come up with on your own. So this being said should these two match or not. The first one is bounding the cabinet and flooring in one tone while the countertops will be a perfect ribbon of different stain. However the solid wood floor should NOT go all the way to. 5e8c397b68b3f4812e9d82ea5a4bad1c Jpg Jpeg Image 1000 800 Pixels French Country Kitchen Cabinets Country Kitchen Cabinets French Country Decorating Kitchen.</p>

<p>Hardwood flooring can last for decades if not centuries with the right upkeep. However limiting the number of finishes keeps the effect from lacking unity and coordination. If you have dark rich cabinetry I would recommend a light hardwood with a tight grain like hickory or maple. Picking out a floor or cabinet you like is an easy task and in the end should work just as well together.
