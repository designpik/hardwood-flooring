<p>We like to offer a guide to understanding the differences between each grade and what you can expect to see to help you decide how clean or rustic you want your flooring. In basic the grading that can be called rustic. In China for example we have A - for perfectly uniform and carefully selected wood B - for timber with some very small imperfections C for middle of the road wood and finally D marking pieces which offer a wide variation of knots and colours. In some countries the flooring system is divided into four grades instead of three. Hardwood Flooring Grades Explained Infographic Hardwood Floors Flooring Hardwood.</p>
