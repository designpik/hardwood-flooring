<p>Often times in a Kitchen there will be an island and the tile has to be installed around that island. Solid unfinished planks. However wood floors generally look better with painted cabinets in the kitchen. We are planning on putting on a siltstone countertop with 3 overhang on one long side 1 on the other and 2 on each short.</p>

<p>It also has white cabinets and drawers that match the walls and ceiling. The white cabinetry and shelving of the surround walls and main kitchen counter is a good foundation for the rest of the design and really opens up. Plank tile 8 wide by 48 long is a big hit as are 12 x 24 ceramic tiles. The wooden counter top brings us closer to nature while the blue acts as a vast deep background. Then there is the dark wood flooring which looks beautiful in combination with white walls and cabinets.</p>
