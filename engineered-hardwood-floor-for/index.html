<p>Engineered hardwood flooring refers to the product made out from a core of hardwood or plywood of about three to twelve layers which are pressed together by means of cross layering and gluing. There is a top layer of hardwood. Solid wood flooring is better suited to installing over plywood surfaces. Engineered hardwood floors have been taking over the flooring industry with their real wood veneer easy installation and ultra-durability.
