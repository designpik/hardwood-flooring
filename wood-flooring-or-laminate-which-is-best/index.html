Yet another exception - if you have solid wood floors not engineered on a pier and beam foundation then you dont have a lot of choice as far as which direction to run the flooring It would best be run perpendicular to the joists. Laminate flooring is known to be extremely tough and durable it is made up of four layers the bottom is a barrier layer next is the base layer which is made up of very dense particle board usually High Density Fibre board HDF then the layer on top of that is a photo paper soaked in a resin finally the top layer is a strong transparent. Laminate is a much cheaper alternative to hardwood flooring but it is not a bad type of flooring. Pin On Home Ideas.</p>
