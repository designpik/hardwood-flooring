<p>Yes you need to keep expansion room at the walls for the flooring to move. Its the same with solid and engineered wood floors. These are fastened to the skirting and allow for expansion. I asked our builder why there was no expansion gap and he said that they dont normally put them unless the room spans 10m or more Ive read that anything over 40m square and 8m in length.
