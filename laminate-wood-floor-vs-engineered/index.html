In very general terms when you buy a laminate floor you can expect a maximum life expectancy of around 20 years whereas a quality engineered wood floor should last for up to 75 years. Laminate is far easier to maintain than engineered wood flooring. Pin By Mallory King On Tips From Tim Laminate Flooring Wood Laminate Flooring Wood Laminate.</p>

<p>These two terms have been around for quite a while yet there remains confusion about the difference between the two. Engineered wood flooring looks just like solid wood but its made differently. Laminate flooring and engineered wood flooring are two obvious choices if you want a flooring that looks like solid hardwood but at a more affordable price. Engineered floors are considered as a valid alternative to the more valuable and therefore expensive solid wood flooring. Pin On Flooring.</p>
