<p>Our high quality and cheap engineered flooring comes in a variety of wood grains and finishes including brushed oiled stained colours and lacquered finishes too. Our brushed and oiled flooring is a fantastic choice for homes and businesses alike. The engineered wood flooring is even suitable for installation on underfloor heating systems. Whilst a standard oil finish accentuates the grain of the solid wood veneer through absorption alone the brushing process adds to this effect.
