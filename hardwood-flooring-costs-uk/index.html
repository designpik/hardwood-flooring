<p>Add fitting and it soars to 1200. Wood flooring cost depends on the cost of material and labor work required. The average supply costs is 45 per m2 for pine 60 per m2 for maple 70 per m2 for walnut 45 per m2 for cherry and anywhere from 18 to 73 per m2 for engineered wood flooring. A rule of thumb for the cost of installing a wooden floor is often said to be double the price of the product however for very expensive flooring this does not quite hold true - we would expect installation costs to come out to around 15 to 30 per square metre depending on where you live and the scale and complexity of the job.
