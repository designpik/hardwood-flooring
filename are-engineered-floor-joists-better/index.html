However if a deeper joist is used on a bigger span the joist price will reduce against a shallow depth as the depth allows the joist to work with smaller timbers and less metal webs. Engineered floor joists are better when the surface its going to hold is a large square footage area or one with heavy material. Given the thickness of the boards I see no reason to lay a sub floor first.

<p>With wooden floor boards as a subfloor engineered wood flooring can also be floated or loose laid over an underlay. The finished floor will be engineered wood which I can get at 206mm and am currently planning on laying directly onto the joists and screwing down. And similar to the floor truss I-joists can span greater distances than 212s. Floor trusses cannot be modified on site due to a field discrepancy without an engineers seal.
