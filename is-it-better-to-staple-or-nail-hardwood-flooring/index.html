Most experts agree that cleats allow for greater movement in areas with high humidity meaning your hardwood flooring will look better longer. Solid hardwood floors must be fixed into position by either gluing or nailing down to the subfloor. With a glued down or nailed down hardwood floor each plank is fastened directly to the subfloor and not to the adjacent plank so when one plank expands it does not necessarily affect the others planks.

<p>If you choose to fix your hardwood floor into position you then have the choice of either gluing your floor to the subfloor using flexible flooring adhesive to create a full surface bond or you can secretly nail your floor. Drill holes through the face of the board at 6 intervals. One other pro of nailing down hardwood floors is that if one floorboard gets damaged it can be easily replaced without affecting the beauty of your floors. But as staples are more comfortable to manufacture you can get staples with a lower budget compared to cleats.
